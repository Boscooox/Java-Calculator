# Java-Calculator  
I'm new to programming. I learned to use visual basic, php, html css.  but I plan very little consistently throughout the year. now I would like to learn java by inserting my projects from time to time. This is my first project, a basic calculator that performs basic operations between 2 numbers. Feel free to comment and judge.
